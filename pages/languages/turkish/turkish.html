<h1>Türkçe!</h1>
<p>
  I started learning Turkish because my first friend came from Turkey, and the more he taught me both about the language
  and the culture the more I began to really love both<br>
  I am learning mostly through the Language Transfer app and by listening to turkish Netflix
</p>
<h2>30/11/24</h2>
<p>
  This is the first language i can actually record my progress on since I'm still learning it.<br>
  Gonna update this page to be in turkish once I know enough of it but rn I'm still very much a beginner<br>
