      My name is Idan, but you can also call me jan Ikela. <br>
      I am a programmer but also like writing and photoshoping and a bunch of stuff! <br>
      Really I just want to create as much as possible. <br>
      I thought it could be nice to have a place to post cool projects, hope you like it :)
